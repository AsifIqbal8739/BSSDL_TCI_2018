function [Xr, Dlist, outputParam]= FRIST_imagedenoising(data, param)
%Function for denoising the gray-scale image using FRIST-based denoising
%algorithm.
%
%Note that all input parameters need to be set prior to simulation. We
%provide some example settings using function FRIST_imagedenoisinge_param.
%However, the user is advised to carefully choose optimal values for the
%parameters depending on the specific data or task at hand.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs -
%       1. data : Image data. The fields are as follows -
%                   - noisy: a*b size gray-scale matrix for denoising
%                   - oracle (optional): a*b size gray-scale matrix as
%                   ground-true, which is used to calculate PSNR
%
%       2. param: Structure that contains the parameters of the
%       OCTOBOS_imagedenoising algorithm. The various fields are as follows
%       -
%                   - isFlipping: whether including flipping
%                   - sig: Standard deviation of the additive Gaussian
%                   noise (Example: 20)
%                   - n: Patch size as (Example: 64)
%                   - stride: stride of overlapping patches
%                   - isUnitary: set to 1, if unitary TL is used
%                   - isMultipass: set to 1, if multipass is applied
%
% Outputs -
%       1. Xr - Image reconstructed with FRIST_imagedenoising algorithm.
%       2. Dlist - learned FRIST.
%       2. outputParam: Structure that contains the parameters of the
%       algorithm output for analysis as follows
%       -
%                   - psnrOut: PSNR of Xr, if the oracle is provided
%                   - time:   run time of the denoising algorithm
